SPECIAL PARTICIPATION ED POST (THIS IS CONTEXT):

Participation Thread: Two parts...

Dear students,

This thread exists only for administrative questions regarding participation.  Asking administrative questions does not count itself as participation. 

As was described briefly in the 0th lecture, your grade in this course includes an active participation dimension.  This is worth 15% of your grade. (As you can tell from the posted bins, without participation, you cannot earn an A of any kind.) There are two components to positive participation (negative participation is any behavior that diminishes the course experience for others... e.g. trolling in online fora, bad behavior in discussion/lecture, etc.):

Ordinary participation (half of the participation grade)

Either: regular and full participation in the in-person discussion sections each week

Or: active helpful participation on Ed: typically this is helpful participation in the homework problem threads, but can also be similarly helpful participation in discussion or lecture threads. Other possibilities also exist --- but there is no spamming way to do this. 

Or: a combination of 1&2 above. 

Special participation (the other half): Must do at least four for full credit. (We'll make special threads for B, C, and E --- with ones for D waiting until that material has been hit in lecture/discussion/homework so it is properly unlocked)

(A. Can be done at most once) Interactively engage a modern LLM on the non-coding parts of a homework (all the non-coding parts of problems) that gets the LLM to arrive at the correct answers --- or demonstrate that this is basically impossible without dragging it there. Post on Ed an annotated log of the entire interaction where you make observations of its behavior and explain the strategies that you are using. Include an executive summary where you note how often the LLM can one-shot questions, misconceptions/hallucinations, etc...  Note: this must be deconflicted with others: we can't have more than one submissions using ChatGPT 5,  etc. The expectation is that with 250ish students and about 13-14 assignments, we'll have at least 18 different major LLMs represented. (e.g. ChatGPT, gpt-oss, Gemini, gemma, Claude, Grok, Llama, Deepseek, Mistral, Qwen, Kimi, etc. as well as their variants --- with and without "thinking", specialized math-oriented finetunes, other non-math-oriented finetunes, etc.)  
You can use: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1KWk_O2wMFEmRR8QmZQ9paRcIgehc9IeD5u_pUgnAp4k/edit?usp=sharing
to help deconflict yourselves. But this is entirely voluntary --- however, only the first post for a particular box will get credit.  

(B. Can do at most once) Interactively engage a modern LLM or co-pilot on the coding parts of a homework. Same as above. (including deconfliction)  Here, you need to think about how to record the log of interactions since it is not as easy as for (1). [Feel free to discuss ideas for how to do this in this thread.] 
Voluntary for deconfliction: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1vmC2ZKx5TXykmMUchbJ4NBFUDKavzDaXVAfN5ueDlAs/edit?usp=sharing

(C. Can do at most twice) Because the code in our problems was evolved till it worked with specific deep-learning-concept related learning objectives, it is often not good code from the perspective of being exemplary from a software engineering  point of view. For example, it is often not very pythonic, etc. You can, ideally with AI assistance that you document carefully vis-a-vis process, take one of the coding problems/demos and refactor it as well as update the code to follow good documented software engineering and ML Engineering processes. Here, we expect you to give citations to the relevant points of good style and document your changes in a report. The constraint is that the problem code shouldn't lose any of its teaching value --- just be transformed to have good coding practices and style. As always, deconfliction is a must however this can be a group effort by up to three people. 

(D. No limits on how many times) As you will soon learn (this week), the traditional approach of doing things like using the Adam (or AdamW) optimizer with a single learning rate for the entire deep network is now on its way to being deprecated in terms of Deep Learning training best practices. Our understanding has now improved with things like muP (maximal update parameterization) and matrix-oriented optimizers like Muon (along with others like SOAP) that seem decisively better. And even in the Adam family, more GPU memory-friendly approaches like Lion (which is a different way of keeping the spirit of signSGD that invokes stochastic dithering to do the job that tracking scale does in Adam when combined with momentum) are ascending. For this option, you have to create additional parts for coding problems that we assign that bring in at least two of these modern approaches. This requires you to make both the additional problem parts (which should include hyperparameter exploration and choice as appropriate) as well as solutions. 
Voluntary deconfliction: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1JcL5cToJs0fGcfaBD5k2dzO24jIk6kWhB1jtiYTsc6I/edit?usp=sharing

(E. Can do at most twice) Make AI-enhanced learning tools for individual concepts and lectures. There are now a plethora of new tools out there (e.g. Guided Learning in Gemini, notebookLM by Google, Study Mode in ChatGPT, Learning mode in Claude, etc... Go ahead and explore/use what's out there) and there are also ways that one can prompt and engage with LLMs even without any special modes that can help you learn on your own. For this option, you should be creating (and sharing with your classmates using an Ed post) whatever prompt/artifact/etc. so that they can also engage in this self-learning together with an interaction trace of you with the tool that shows how it can potentially help. This trace should be annotated critically by you pointing out where it is hallucinating, wrong, or misleading --- as well as places where you think it is doing a good job.  One way to think about what you're trying to achieve is as an active AI replacement/substitute for the traditional approach of pre-lecture (or post-lecture) readings that you do to understand the material better before you delve into the homework or your own projects. 

Between A,B,C,D, and E above, you have lots of ways to create something useful and helpful for your classmates (both current and future...) while hopefully also learning a lot yourself in the process. Our goal is to have you engage with the Deep Learning material in a way that recognizes the transformative achievements of Deep Learning in engaging with material. We want your engagement with AI tools to enhance your learning, not inhibit it. 


Edited to add: There are two steps to submission of this: (1) Post on Ed. This is really important because the whole point is to create something of value both to yourself and to your classmates. (2) Submit to Gradescope --- there are assignments there for A, B, C, and E. For C and E where you can submit twice, there are two distinct assignments so that you can submit first to one and then do a different one for the second assignments. There is nothing there yet for D because that hasn't been unlocked by lecture yet.

INITIAL EXTRA CREDIT ED ANNOUNCEMENT:

Extra Credit Opportunity --- curate special participation posts

Please see the new updated extra credit post here: https://edstem.org/us/courses/84647/discussion/7395242

Dear students, 

We've enjoyed reading your extra credits posts and engagement throughout the semester and found it very interesting ourselves. So much so that we would like to record this for posterity and create a forum that allows you to get visibility for this. This means we can follow up on some of your ideas more easily as well (with due credit of course). As a first step in this direction, we would like to create a searchable website that will document all participation for each of the extra credit participation categories. This would allow us, and other students, to easily navigate through the different ideas and explore what works for them and what does not. Furthermore, our goal will be to link student websites/linked-in pages, so all of you can gain visibility on the work you have done. This website will be hosted on the eecs182.org.

We are offering 5-10 points of extra credit per student (more points for better quality submissions, more points for the categories we care about more) for students who help make such a website. We understand this will be a significant lift, but hope you can leverage deep learning skills to make this happen. Ideally, this will be presented as a directory that we can simply drop into the eecs182 website. Multiple students are allowed to collaborate on this as below:


We care the most about this for E since this allows us to easily build tools in the future.

Special Participation E: 3-4 students
A nice version of this would categorize the submissions into different types of submissions (e.g. generating new questions, helping understand existing content, creating new content etc. --- come up with your own categories.) If you think some submissions are particularly impressive, highlight them. 

Second we care about documenting student interactions with LLMs.

Special Participation A: 3-4 students
Special Participation B: 3-4 students
For each of these two cases, we would like to have a summary of insights on how each of the different LLMs behave and common issues. What insights were gained from 

Third we care about the Muon and MuP updates

Special Participation D: 2 students

Last (fourth) priority

Since it would be nice to have this all coordinated in one website, if someone wants to take on a coordination role: 1-2 students. 
For each kind of special participation we should be able to read what every student submitted as text and as attachment. Every student should get credited for the work they have put in. Include links to student websites/github repos if those are included in the post (All students --- feel free to go and edit your posts to include this information so that they will show up in the common collection).

Bonus points if the website is searchable by keyword/student name etc. Other design choices we leave up to you. Feel free to ask questions below.  


Please do not claim a spot to complete this unless you are truly planning to, since it does not allow others to take this on. Use this thread to self-organize so you can make teams to do this. 

Thanks,

182 Staff

ED UPDATE ANNOUNCEMENT:

Extra Credit Update

We were overwhelmed by the response to the Extra Credit Post --- we thought there would only be a few students interested.

In light of this, we are changing the nature of the extra credit to try a new experiment  --- so please ask clarification questions if anything isn't clear.


The new rules for extra credit are as follows. For each participation category there will be Blue Teams and Red Teams.

Red Team: The job of the Red Team is to establish a baseline. What is the best website that can be purely AI generated (with human guidance)? So be smart about how you prompt and thoughtful about the design, but code should be mostly AI written. Any analysis, summarization, grouping etc. should also be done by an AI. Meta level orchestrations is fine by a person. For instance, you can read a subset of the posts for validation purposes, but you should not read all the posts. It should be as though a human never looked at any of the posts or submissions to understand what they are doing. Ideally though there should be a functioning website that displays all content in a readable fashion. If you end up in a situation where it not possible to prompt engineer your way to fucntionality, put in the minimum human effort required to get this functioning and then document a short document/paragraph explaining what was done by an agent and where basic human intervention was necessary. All Red Team submissions will be awarded 4-5 points per student team member. Please feel free to ask clarification questions -- the goal of this is more to do a fun experiment than to be some ridiculous hoop that must be jumped through, we're very curious how far this can get! 

Blue Team: Your job is to do better than the Red Teams. You may use as much AI as you wish to help generate your website but we ask that you go beyond. Blue Teams will be awarded 5-10 points credit per student (based on staff judgement) if they can do better than the baseline. 

Note that these points are added to the total points in the course.

Please add yourself to the spreadsheet below so it will be easier to track the teams: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/14QaSXdvKzj1UGRjPJ6-udmzQSB_UyyS5fl4-VvT6sLs/edit?gid=0#gid=0

Note: all the constraints in the earlier post still apply. Max team size is still 4 etc. 

https://edstem.org/us/courses/84647/discussion/7384785

Also note: You may only sign up for ONE team.

HERE IS A SUBMISSION FOR SPECIAL PARTICIPATION E, BLUE TEAM THAT HAS A LOT OF GOOD FEATURES WE SHOULD EMULATE/FOLLOW/EXCEED:

Extra Credit Website: Blue Team, Special Participation E

Group members: Devan Perkash, Rahul Bir, Ethan Stone, Micah Mok

Blue Team Website for Special Participation E

We built a website to make Special Participation E submissions usable at scale, rather than living in an archived Ed feed. Our goal was to turn these posts into something that students can actively study from and that staff can review efficiently.

Here’s how our site concretely adds value beyond Ed:

Lecture-aligned playlist view
Our "playlist" page organizes Special Participation E posts by lecture topic and week. For each lecture, it surfaces relevant student submissions (e.g. tools, visualizations, explanations tied to that topic). This lets someone studying a specific lecture immediately see how peers engaged with that material, rather than guessing search keywords or scrolling through weeks of posts.

Save posts to build a personal study guide
As students browse the site, they can save posts they find useful, and those saved posts show up directly in the playlist under the relevant lecture topics. This allows students to build a personalized study guide over the semester (e.g. “good optimizer visualizations” or “helpful transformer papers”) rather than re-searching the directory each time.

Fast browsing with Quick View
From the directory, users can open a “Quick View” panel for any post to skim its content without leaving the page. This makes it easy to rapidly scan many submissions, compare approaches, or review posts without opening dozens of tabs (as most of us in this class have likely experienced while studying!)—especially helpful given the number of submissions.

Strong search and filtering that’s always available
The directory supports full-text search across titles, student names, summaries, and tags, along with category filters (e.g. Exam Prep, Paper / Reading, Tools & Implementation). The search bar stays accessible even when scrolling deep into results, so refining queries is always quick.

Meaningful categorization based on how students actually contributed
Posts are grouped into a small set of high-signal categories (paper reviews, visualizations, tools, etc.). These reflect topic patterns in the submissions and help users quickly understand what kind of resource a post is before opening it.

Highlighted submissions
Some posts are explicitly highlighted (e.g. interactive demos, detailed tools, substantial writeups). This makes it easy to quickly find strong examples, while still keeping the full set of submissions visible.

Embedded PDFs and automatic artifact extraction
Links and attachments are automatically extracted from posts. PDFs are embedded directly in the post page with an "expand" option, so users can read them inline instead of opening new tabs. Students can quickly click the extracted links from posts without having to search within the posts manually. Direct download links are still available for quick access.

Similar contributions for contextual exploration
Each post page shows related submissions at the bottom of the page with overlapping topics or formats. This helps users explore alternative explanations, tools, or perspectives on the same concept, rather than searching manually.

Clean, intuitive UI designed for repeated use
The interface is intentionally minimal and clean, optimized for scanning, filtering, and revisiting content throughout the semester rather than just browsing once. Design decisions were made to optimize for efficient use. For instance, when a student searches for a keyword, the site will automatically highlight the matching keyword within all returned search results, facilitating faster content discovery.
